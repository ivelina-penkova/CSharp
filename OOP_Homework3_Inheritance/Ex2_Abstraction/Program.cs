/*
In an RPG game there are different types of characters – mages, warriors, priests, etc. 
They have some common characteristics, so it’s a good idea to have a base class which describes these common characteristics and 
let the descendants reuse them through inheritance. There are also a set of actions the characters can perform; actions are usually 
defined in interfaces.
